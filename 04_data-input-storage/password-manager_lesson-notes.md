#Creating a node project that uses NPM.

Run inside your project's root directory:
`$ npm init`

NPM stands for Node Packaged Modules. It's a way to install third party libraries into your application.

At initialization, NPM will ask set up questions. (This can be bypassed by setting up your `package.json` manually.)
